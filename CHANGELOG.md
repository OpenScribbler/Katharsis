# Changelog

Every change an installer can see is listed here, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). A release is the `katharsis--v<version>` tag whose
section this file carries. Tests, CI, and repo housekeeping are not listed.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A MOAT attestation for the rule set: `.moat/publisher.yml` declares `rules/` as the
  `katharsis-rules` item, so every push to `main` signs it beside the three skills, and
  `SECURITY.md` documents what the attestation covers and how to check it.
- Three rule files under `rules/`, a loader, and the five-placeholder contract in
  `rules/placeholders.yaml`.
- `katharsis-setup`, which discovers the installer's memory file and conventions on disk,
  substitutes the placeholders, and writes one managed block.
- `katharsis-audit`, which rewrites the reference counts from the installer's own transcripts,
  builds before/after pairs, gates rule proposals on evidence, and audits the memory store.
- `writing-examples`, with one worked pair per rule and three full-message rewrites.
- `scripts/detect-prose.sh`, which counts all eleven failure modes in session logs with no
  model in the loop.
- A reversible install: every write lands in `.katharsis-install.json`, and
  `scripts/uninstall-rules.sh` and `scripts/settings-edit.sh` reverse only what it records.
